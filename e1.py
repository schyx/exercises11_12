# Write a program that lets the user choose a number n,
# and then prints the numbers from 1 to n, including both 1 and n
#
# For example, if the user input 3, the program would have the following output
#   1
#   2
#   3
#
#
# Hints:
#   Recall the `input` builtin function! What type does it give you?
