# Write a script that takes user-given positive integer to draw a `left
# justified pyramid`, using the asterisk symbol, of that size.
#
# For example, if the user gave 3 as the input, the expected output would be:
#
# *
# **
# ***
#
# Hints:
#   1. Start small. How would you print just one single asterisk?
#   2. Once you have that, how would you print 2 asterisks on the same line?
#       Have we learned any ways to repeat characters?
