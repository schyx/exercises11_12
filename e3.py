# Write a script that takes user-given positive integer to draw a `centered
# pyramid`, using the asterisk symbol, of that size.
#
# For example, if the user gave 3 as the input, the expected output would be:
#
#   *
#  ***
# *****
#
# Hints:
#   1. This is a more challenging exercise that builds off of e2. Do e2 first!
#   2. How many asterisks are on the 2nd line? What about the 3rd line?
#       How many spaces are on the 2nd line (before the first asterisk)?
#       What about the 3rd line? Do you see a pattern?
